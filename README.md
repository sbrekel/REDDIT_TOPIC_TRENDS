- No private messages or personally identifiable information (PII) will be collected.
- Data will be used solely for research and analytics purposes.

## Intended Features
- Trend detection across multiple subreddits.
- Keyword extraction and frequency analysis.
- Time-series visualization of topic popularity.
- Optional sentiment analysis to gauge public opinion.

## Development Status
This project is currently in early development. Code and further implementation details will be added as the project progresses.

## Technology Stack (Planned)
- Python 3.x
- [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/) (Python Reddit API Wrapper)
- Pandas & NumPy for data analysis
- Matplotlib / Plotly for visualization

## Repository
This repository will host the source code for the Reddit Trend Analysis Tool, including scripts for data collection, processing, and visualization.
